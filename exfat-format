The Teledigital recorder appears to work with both vfat and exfat filesystems.  Exfat is the default and appears to allow recording to begin within about 3 seconds.  Many Android phones, notably Google Pixels, cannot use exfat and will attempt to reformat the device.  If reformatted as VFAT with the proper directories everything will work but recording start will be delayed to about 8 seconds.  The author feels this makes the device unusable and undesirable.
